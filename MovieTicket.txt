Movie Ticket Booking System
Problem Statement:
You are designing a simple Movie Ticket Booking System for a theater. The system should handle ticket bookings and cancellations based on seat availability.

Theater Details: The theater has a fixed number of seats.

Booking Requests:
If a seat is available, the booking is successful.
If all seats are booked, the request is rejected.


Cancellation:
A user can cancel their ticket, making the seat available again.


Check Availability:
The system should return the number of available seats.


Input Format:
The first integer N represents the total number of seats in the theater.
The next integer M represents the number of queries.
The following M lines contain queries, which can be:
"BOOK Name" → Attempts to book a seat.
"CANCEL Name" → Cancels a booking.
"CHECK" → Checks available seats.


Output Format:
If a booking is successful: "Booking confirmed for Name"
If the theater is full: "Booking failed for Name"
If a cancellation is successful: "Name's ticket has been canceled"
If a cancellation fails (name not found): "Name does not have a booking"
For seat availability checks: "X seats available"


Example Input:

BOOK Alice  
BOOK Bob  
BOOK Charlie  
BOOK David

Example Output:


Booking confirmed for Alice
